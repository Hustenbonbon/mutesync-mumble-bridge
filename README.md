# mutesync-mumble-bridge

A small bridge that lets mutesync communicate with mumble

## Setup

1. clone repository

2. yarn install or npm install

3. Take care that you have a symlink for mumble, adding to the path or an alias aren't sufficient
> This means you can type `mumble` in your terminal and it opens mumble

4. run `node main.js`
